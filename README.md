# Django Help Desk Application

## Overview

This is a Help Desk system built with Django. It includes the core backend functionalities required for managing tickets, users, comments, notifications, and a knowledge base. The application is designed to streamline support processes, offering solutions for handling user requests, tracking issues, and managing help resources.

**Important:** The frontend of the application has not been developed yet, so there is no clean user interface. The backend is functional.

## Features

### 1. **Ticket Management**
   - Create, update, and track the status of support tickets.
   - Support for assigning tickets to specific users.

### 2. **User Management**
   - Full user authentication and authorization system.
   - Role-based access control (e.g., admin, operator, user).

### 3. **Knowledge Base**
   - A repository of articles and solutions to common issues.

### 4. **Comments**
   - Users and agents can comment on tickets for ongoing discussions.

### 5. **Notifications**
   - In-app notifications to keep users updated about ticket changes.
   - Notifications for ticket assignments, updates, and comments.

## Backend
The backend is fully built using Django and its powerful ORM for handling data and relationships between tickets, users, and other entities. It leverages Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system for managing users, permissions, and security.
